lexpublica-source
=================

law is society's source - these scripts get laws onto lexpublica@github

lex = source code
executive = cpu
judicative = compiler
legislative = programmer
citizens = user
taxes = license fee
bad lex = embezzlement of fee

it's time we exert more direct control of the source code of our society.
The tools that have helped us building complex systems like the Linux Kernel are perfectly capable to help humans organise their society in a more fair and quicker way than it is done today.
